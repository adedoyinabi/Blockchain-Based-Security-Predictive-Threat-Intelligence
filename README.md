# Blockchain-Based Security Predictive Threat Intelligence

A comprehensive blockchain-based system for managing predictive threat intelligence using Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain.

## Overview

This system provides a decentralized platform for security providers to share, analyze, and respond to predictive threat intelligence. It ensures transparency, accountability, and accuracy in threat prediction and response coordination.

## System Architecture

### Core Contracts

1. **Security Provider Contract** (`security-provider.clar`)
    - Manages provider registration and verification
    - Tracks reputation scores and provider statistics
    - Ensures only verified providers can participate

2. **Intelligence Gathering Contract** (`intelligence-gathering.clar`)
    - Handles submission of threat intelligence data
    - Manages threat sources and their reliability scores
    - Stores predictive threat information with confidence levels

3. **Threat Analysis Contract** (`threat-analysis.clar`)
    - Processes threat intelligence through expert analysis
    - Builds consensus from multiple analyst inputs
    - Generates risk scores and recommended actions

4. **Response Coordination Contract** (`response-coordination.clar`)
    - Coordinates threat response efforts
    - Manages response teams and escalation procedures
    - Tracks response effectiveness and status

5. **Accuracy Measurement Contract** (`accuracy-measurement.clar`)
    - Evaluates prediction accuracy over time
    - Maintains provider performance metrics
    - Tracks overall system effectiveness

- Clarity CLI tools
- Node.js for testing

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   \`\`\`bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd blockchain-threat-intelligence
   \`\`\`

2. Install dependencies
   \`\`\`bash
   npm install
   \`\`\`

3. Deploy contracts to testnet
   \`\`\`bash
   clarinet deploy --testnet
   \`\`\`

### Usage Examples

#### Register as a Security Provider
\`\`\`clarity
(contract-call? .security-provider register-provider "CyberSec Corp")
\`\`\`

#### Submit Threat Intelligence
\`\`\`clarity
(contract-call? .intelligence-gathering submit-threat-intelligence
"malware"
u4
(list "web-servers" "databases")
u85
0x1234567890abcdef
)
\`\`\`

#### Analyze Threat
\`\`\`clarity
(contract-call? .threat-analysis submit-threat-analysis
u1
u8
"High risk of data breach"
(list "isolate-systems" "patch-vulnerabilities")
u90
)
\`\`\`

## Contract Interactions

### Data Flow
1. Providers register and get verified
2. Threat intelligence is submitted with confidence levels
3. Multiple analysts provide risk assessments
4. Consensus is built from analyst inputs
5. Response teams coordinate mitigation efforts
6. Accuracy is measured and tracked over time

### Security Features
- Only verified providers can submit data
- Multi-signature validation for critical operations
- Immutable audit trail of all activities
- Reputation-based access controls

## Testing

Run the test suite:
\`\`\`bash
npm test
\`\`\`

Tests cover:
- Contract deployment and initialization
- Provider registration and verification
- Threat intelligence submission and retrieval
- Analysis consensus building
- Response coordination workflows
- Accuracy measurement and tracking
